<div id="bio"><h1>About Ryan Gilbert</h1><p><img class="img" src="images/bio.JPG" alt="Picture of me"/>My name is Ryan Gilbert when I finished High School I joined the Army and became a Scout and a Paratrooper.  I decided not to re-enlist mainly because I came to the conclusion that I hate running and on average I ended up having to run 45 miles a week.  There was a number of other reason also but, after 4-years I was ready to move on.  For several years I jumped from job to job trying to figure out what I wanted to do when I grow up.  I worked as a forester, wild land firefighter, a carpenter, cabinet maker, a cook, welder, an HVAC tech. a roofer, a waste water treatment operator and probably some others I cant think of right now.  I found my self learning these jobs and working them for about six months then I would get bored and start looking for something different.

While I was in the Army I picked up a 1995 era HTML book and started working through it.  This was around 2004-2005 so the book was already very outdated but, it got me interested.  I always had inclinations to become an entrepreneur last year I decided that I wanted to start a web design business.  The only problem was is had been years since I since I had even owned a computer or messed with HTML.  So I hit the books and found myself at Clark College.  I also just got married about 6 months ago which should explain the cheesy wedding photo.  If you would like to email me see my <a href="contact.html">Contact Page</a></p></div>
